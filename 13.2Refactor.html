    Okay we won't be giving you a long ass review, hell no! we hust want to convince you how watching this series will change your life. But hey, friendly advise start by watching season three, one and too are a bit boring, and you'll basically understand eveything by season 3. Well, they are realted but not that much, since each season has a different story.
